This side project was made as an entry for the "Ugly Website Design Competition" - a non-mandatory competition while I attended the coding bootcamp Tech Elevator. The visual aesthetic is intentionally an eyesore (for example the logo in the upper left), in line with the theme of the competition. I taught myself React to create this project (it wasn't part of the Tech Elevator curriculum).
I am still adding features (Results in particular).
